# PathProof

PathProof is a defensive, cloud-agnostic attack-path verification engine.

It ingests infrastructure and software-supply-chain artifacts, models security
relationships as an evidence-backed graph, detects attack paths, generates
minimal remediation patches, and proves through rescanning that paths were
broken.

## Current milestone

Build a tested Go CLI with the first deterministic, evidence-backed in-memory
graph slice for Kubernetes routing.

Implemented Kubernetes support is intentionally small:

- Parse `Service`, `Deployment`, `networking.k8s.io/v1` `Ingress`, and
  `ServiceAccount` manifests from local YAML files.
- Resolve public Services and Ingresses to Deployment workloads.
- Model each Deployment as running as a ServiceAccount, using observed
  ServiceAccount manifests when present and inferred accounts when missing.

## Usage

```sh
go run ./cmd/pathproof version
```

Expected output:

```text
pathproof dev
```

## Development

```sh
make check
make build
```

The built binary is written to `bin/pathproof`.
